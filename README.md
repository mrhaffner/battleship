This is for the Battleship assignment for The Odin Project.

The purpose of this project is gain experience with Test Driven Development, particularly with mocks in Jest.

This project was built using React, Lodash, and Styled Components.

The project is currently fully functional.  I would like to add the option for drag and drop placement of the ships and smarter AI.
